🚀 Quick Start
Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
bashnpm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
bashnpm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.
bashnpm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.
The build is minified and filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
bashnpm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
